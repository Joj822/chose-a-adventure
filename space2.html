      Ok. Come with me to our home planet of Hurakas. Uh Oh! We must go on our
      highly advanced teleporting syst and I don't know if it can teleport a
      human being. I have pills to help you but I can't remember which one to
      take. There is a red pill and a blue pill or you can use nothing at all.

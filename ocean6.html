     <h1>Ocean</h1>
     <p>You go back into the castle and turn to the king. You both take out your sword. He snaps his fingers and 12 of the best gaurds appear! You tell the Dolphin to charge at six and the you will take the other six. He runs of chaging at every gaurd he sees! You charge at one then the other! Knocking them down! The king says: "You cant beat this one though!" He pointed to one of his soldiers. You respond: "Oh, yes we can!" This time you snap your fingers and fifty Katolis Soldiers come out! The king bursts out: "WHAT!?!?!?!?!?"</p>
